## 🎮 Python List Mastery Challenge

The **List Mastery Challenge** is a Python mini-adventure where you tame a list using the powers of built-in methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, and more.

### 🧩 Operations Performed

🔹 Create an empty list  
🔹 Append elements (10, 20, 30, 40)  
🔹 Insert `15` at index `1`  
🔹 Extend with `[50, 60, 70]`  
🔹 Remove the last element using `pop()`  
🔹 Sort the list in ascending order  
🔹 Find the index of the value `30`  

### 🧪 Final Output

```text
print the list : [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
the index of 30 is : 3
